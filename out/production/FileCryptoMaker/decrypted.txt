In earlier JDK releases, there were no RSA signature providers available in the JDK, therefore SunJSSE had to provide its own RSA implementation in order to use commonly available RSA-based certificates. JDK 5 introduced the SunRsaSign provider, which provides all the functionality (and more) of the SunJSSE provider. Applications targeted at JDK 5.0 and later should request instances of the SunRsaSign provider instead. For backward compatibility, the RSA algorithms are still available through this provider, but are actually implemented in the SunRsaSign provider.
